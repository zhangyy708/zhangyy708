Hi! I'm @zhangyy708 and I have uploaded most of the codes that I use for school assignments/projects, at work, and for fun! 

## bandit-task 

Stores the codes that I used in my master's thesis. [Demo](https://zhangyy708.github.io/bandit-task/) simulates a game that needs players to choose among several 'slot-machines'.

## [mancala](https://zhangyy708.github.io/mancala/), [reversi](https://zhangyy708.github.io//reversi/), and [five-in-a-row](https://zhangyy708.github.io/five-in-a-row/)

When I worked on the above project, sometimes I felt bored and entertained myself by making small games. 

## [head_xy](https://github.com/zhangyy708/head_xy)

When I tried to make live2d models, I found myself bad at perspectives, so I wrote a script to help me find the approximate shape of a face and positions of eyes and a mouth when the face turns to a certain degree. 

## [GRE Analytic Writing](https://github.com/zhangyy708/GRE-AW-pool)

When I worked as a GRE writing teacher, I noticed my colleagues just copied and pasted all the questions published on ETS website. Then I just thought, "why not write a script to avoid the repetitive work?"

I used R because I had not learned Python at that time.
